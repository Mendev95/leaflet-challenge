# leaflet-challenge
This project uses Leaflet, D3.js, and the CartoDB Positron tileset to create a grayscale map aesthetic for the visualisation of earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). It shows how to depict the locations and magnitudes of earthquakes on a global map using GeoJSON data. By clicking on the data dots, users can interact with the visualisation and get additional details about individual earthquake events.
